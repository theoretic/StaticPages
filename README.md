# StaticPages
Lazy static pages generator for Processwire CMS.

## How does it work

Normally Processwire renders any page any time it's requested. StaticPages module allows Processwire to render certain pages only once. When it happens, StaticPages creates a static html file located corresponding to the URL which has been requested. The following requeststs to this URL will not be handled by Processwire. The previously created html file will be returned by the server.

Module reacts to the following events:

- Page render: a new static html file is created.
- Page save: all previously generated html files will be deleted.
- Page delete: all previously generated html files will be deleted.
- Single field save: all previously generated html files will be deleted. Inline admin edits and `$page->setAndSave()` never reach a page save. Can be switched off in the module settings.
- Config save of a listed module: all previously generated html files will be deleted. Modules like SettingsFactory keep site-wide settings in their own module config data and save no page, so a page save event never happens even though the settings end up in the markup. List such modules in the *Wipe on config save of these modules* setting, one class name per line.
- Tracked file change: all previously generated html files will be deleted. Editing a template or an asset file fires no ProcessWire event at all, so nothing would tell the module its static files went stale. The patterns listed in the *Track changes in these paths* setting are checked on admin requests by file name, modification time and size; file contents are never read. `*` matches inside one path segment, `**` matches any number of segments including none.

## Installation

- Download or git clone this repository
- Copy the StaticPages folder inside /my-processwire-project/site/modules directory
- Go to PW admin page
- Go to Modules admin page
- Hit Refresh button
- Locate the newly found StaticPages module in the Site tab
- Hit Install button
- Modify module settings at will
- **Important!**
	- Locate .htaccess file inside /my-processwire-project/
	- Locate the following string:
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	- Comment it with the \# symbol
	- Save the file

## Limits of path tracking

- The check runs on admin requests only. A fully cached URL never reaches PHP, so there is no front end request left to hang it on. A developer who edits files and never opens the admin will not see the cache wiped.
- Checks are throttled to once every 10 seconds so that admin ajax does not walk the tracked directories on every keystroke.
- Only the modification time and the size are compared. An edit changing neither goes unnoticed.
- Symlinked directories inside a tracked path are not descended into. A symlinked base directory is fine.
- A hash file that is missing or unreadable is treated as a first run: it is seeded, nothing is wiped. So a deploy that clears `site/assets/cache/` and changes templates in the same step will not wipe. Deploy scripts should ask for it directly:

```php
$modules->get('StaticPages')->checkTrackedPaths(true);  //check now, ignoring the throttle
$modules->get('StaticPages')->wipeCaches(true);         //or just wipe, full disk scan
```

## Warning

However tested and used on several websites, hosting platforms and environments, this mode should be considered as beta release. Use it at Your own risk. Since StaticPages may perform bulk files and folders deletion, it's strongly advised to make the full website backup before the first use.
